// 1. Assign the message "Hello, World!" to a variable.
var easy = "Hello, World!";

// 2. Assign a different string to a variable name of your choice.
var different = "This is a different string.";

// 3. Assign a number to a variable.
var num = 5;

// 4. Use string concatenation to display the number from #3 in a string.
var num_different = num + " " + different;

// 5. Make an array of at least four of your favorite movies or books or bands.
var favs = ["Cryptonomicon", "Lord of the Rings", "Hook", "The Fountainhead"];

// 6. Make a object of information about yourself with at least four properties.
var person = {
    firstname: "Hamilton",
    lastname: "Clark",
    age: 30,
    haircolor: "brown"
    eyecolor: "green"
};

// 7. Make an array of objects containing more information about your favorite movies. The objects should have at least three properties.
var array7 = [favs.length, favs[favs.length -1], favs[0]];

// 8. Use `for` to loop through the answer from exercise #7 and print only one property from the object. i.e., given `{ title: "Gone with the Wind" }` you print "Gone with the Wind".
